Problem 1
---------

Import and Clean the Data:

``` r
# import data and format data with appropriate variable names
nyc_transit_data = read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
# select wanted variables
  select(line, station_name, route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, station_latitude, station_longitude, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>% 
# convert the class of variable "entry" to logical
  mutate(entry = recode(entry,`YES` = TRUE, `NO` = FALSE )) 
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route9 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route10 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route11 = col_integer(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

The nyc\_transit\_data dataset contains 19 variables, which are line, station, route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, station\_latitude, station\_longitude, entry, vending, entrance\_type, ada

I first import data and use janitor:clean\_names to convert the names of the variable, then selected the variable of interest from the original dataset and recode the value of "entry" variable to logical variable.

There are 19 columns and 1868 rows in the dataset.

The dataset is not tidy although all the column are variables, rows are observations and every value has a cell, route number has spread across 11 columns.

There are 465 distinct stations.

84 stations are ADA compliant.

0.3770492 of station entrances/exits without vending allow entrance.

Tidy Data

``` r
# tidy nyc_transit_data
# make route number and route name distinct variables
nyc_transit_tidy = gather(nyc_transit_data, key = "route_number", value = "route_name", route1:route11)
```

Route A Data

``` r
#exclude all the route name except A 
nyc_transit_a = filter(nyc_transit_tidy, route_name == "A")
```

There are 60 distinct stations serve the A train.

Of the stations that serves A train, 17 of them are ADA compliant.

Problem 2
---------

Import and Clean Mr Trash Wheel

``` r
library(readxl)
# import data from excel with specify sheet number = 1, omit column with notes
mr_trash_wheel = read_excel("data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = 1, range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>%
#clean name
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
# omit rows do not include dumpster-specific data
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
# round the number of sports balls.
# convert the class of sports balls to integer
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls, digits = 0)))
```

Import and Restructure Precitation Data

``` r
# import precipitation data on 2017
prcp_2017 = read_excel("data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = 4, range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(!is.na(total)) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017)
# import precipitation data on 2016
prcp_2016 = read_excel("data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = 5, range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(!is.na(total)) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2016)
# bind prcp_2017 and prcp_2016
prcp = bind_rows(prcp_2017, prcp_2016) %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

Mr Trash Wheel contains 285 observations of 14 variables, and the key variables in this dataframe is the detail of the trash each dumpster collected, such as sports\_balls, weight\_tons. The joint precipitation data of 2017 and 2016 contains 24 observations of 3 variables and the key variables are month, year and total.

The total precipitation in 2017 is 32.93

The median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2016 is 26.

Problem 3
---------

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("p8105/p8105.datasets")
```

    ## Skipping install of 'p8105.datasets' from a github remote, the SHA1 (21f5ad1c) has not changed since last install.
    ##   Use `force = TRUE` to force installation

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
```

Import and Tidy Data

``` r
brfss_tidy =
  brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(-class,-topic, -question, -sample_size,-(confidence_limit_low:geo_location)) %>%  
  filter(response %in% c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")) %>% 
  spread(key = response, value = data_value) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(excellent_verygood = (excellent + very_good)/(excellent + very_good + good + fair + poor))   
  #variable unit
```

``` r
state_freq = count(brfss_tidy,locationabbr) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

There are 404 unique locations, and those locations are from 51 different state. Since the United States has 50 states in addition to Washington DC, we conclude that all the states were represented.

The most observed city is NJ.

In 2002, the median of "Excellent" response value is 23.6.

Histogram of "Excellent" value in 2002

``` r
brfss_2002 = brfss_tidy %>%
  filter(year == 2002)
ggplot(brfss_2002, aes(x = excellent)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

    ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).

Scatterplot of Excellent proportion NY and Queens(2002-2010)

``` r
brfss_excellent_ny_queens = brfss_tidy %>% 
    filter(locationdesc %in% c("NY - New York County", "NY - Queens County", year == 2002:2010 ))
```

    ## Warning in year == 2002:2010: longer object length is not a multiple of
    ## shorter object length

``` r
ggplot(brfss_excellent_ny_queens, aes(x = year, y = excellent, color = locationdesc)) +
  geom_point()
```
